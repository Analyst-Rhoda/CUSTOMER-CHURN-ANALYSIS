## Introduction

In todayâ€™s world, keeping customers is just as important as getting new ones. But what happens when customers start leaving? And why are they leaving in the first place?

Thatâ€™s the story I wanted to uncover in this project. I took raw customer data from a telecom company and turned it into a powerful, easy-to-understand dashboard using **Power BI**. My goal was to help decision-makers understand whatâ€™s really going on â€” and what they can do about it.

## The Business Problem

Imagine owning a business where people can cancel their service at any time. You work hard to bring customers in, but suddenly, they start leaving. You notice the numbers dropping, and youâ€™re not sure why. This is called **customer churn**.

**Churn** simply means customers are **leaving your company**. They might cancel their internet service, switch to a competitor, or stop paying for a product.

For a telecom company, high churn means **lost revenue**, **lower trust**, and **high marketing costs** because now you have to work twice as hard to find new customers.

This project answers one important question:

> **Why are customers leaving, and how can we make them stay?**

---

## Project Goal

My goal was to:

* Understand why customers are leaving (churning)
* Show this information clearly using dashboards
* Help business leaders make smart decisions to reduce churn

---

## Understanding the Dataset

The data came from a telecom company. It contains information about **7,043 customers**.

Each customer record included:

* **Who they are** (age group, gender, partner status)
* **What services they use** (internet, phone, streaming, etc.)
* **How they pay** (credit card, bank transfer, electronic check)
* **How long theyâ€™ve been a customer**
* **Whether they left (churned) or stayed**

---

## Tools I Used

* **Power BI**: To build interactive and beautiful dashboards
* **Power Query**: To clean and prepare the data
* **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: To create custom metrics
* **Excel**: For some initial exploration

---

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Data Cleaning

* Removed any errors or blanks
* Made sure all the information was in the right format

### 2. Data Modeling

* Connected different parts of the data to each other
* Created calculations like "Churn Rate" and "Total Customers"

### 3. Visualization (Building the Dashboard)

* Created charts, graphs, and slicers to explore patterns
* Made the dashboard easy to navigate for anyone, even non-technical users

### 4. Storytelling

* Organized the visuals to answer business questions step by step

---

## Dashboard Breakdown

Here's what you'll find on the dashboard:

* **Summary Cards**: Total customers, total churned, overall churn rate
* **Customer Profile**: Who is most likely to leave based on age, gender, and more
* **Service Insights**: Are certain services linked to more churn?
* **Payment Behavior**: Does the payment method affect loyalty?
* **Contract Type**: Are short-term customers leaving more?
* **Tenure and Charges**: How long customers stay and how much they pay

---

## What I Found (Key Insights)

### 1. Short Contracts = High Risk

Most people who left had **month-to-month** contracts. It makes sense â€” itâ€™s easier to leave when thereâ€™s no commitment.

### 2. New Customers Are Leaving Early

Many customers who churned had been with the company for **less than a year**. This means the **first few months are critical**.

### 3. Electronic Checks Cause Friction

People who paid using **electronic checks** churned more. Possibly because itâ€™s less convenient or they had billing issues.

### 4. No Tech Support = Frustrated Users

Customers with **fiber optic internet** but **no technical support** were more likely to leave. This suggests they had problems but couldnâ€™t get help.

### 5. High Charges Drive People Away

Customers with **high monthly bills** were more likely to churn. Price sensitivity is a real concern.

---

## Why These Things Are Happening (Root Causes)

* **Flexibility Without Value**: Month-to-month users donâ€™t feel locked in, so if service or price doesnâ€™t meet their expectations, they leave easily.

* **Poor Onboarding Experience**: New customers might not fully understand the services or face issues without enough support.

* **Billing Hassles**: Electronic checks may lead to payment delays or confusion, making customers frustrated.

* **Lack of Support**: No technical support means customers feel stranded when issues arise.

* **Perceived Overpricing**: When customers donâ€™t see the value in what theyâ€™re paying for, they look elsewhere.

---

## What the Business Can Do (Recommendations)

### 1. Encourage Longer Contracts

* Offer discounts or rewards for customers who switch to **yearly contracts**.
* Show value in staying long-term.

### 2. Improve Customer Onboarding

* Create a strong welcome program to teach customers how to use the services.
* Follow up during the first 90 days to solve issues early.

### 3. Make Billing Easier

* Promote auto-pay through **credit cards** or **bank transfer** (these methods had lower churn).
* Simplify the billing process and improve communication.

### 4. Add or Bundle Tech Support

* Offer tech support as part of internet plans, especially for fiber users.
* Educate customers on how to get help quickly.

### 5. Re-evaluate Pricing

* Analyze if high bills can be reduced or packaged better.
* Offer loyalty discounts for long-term users.

## Why This Matters (Business Impact)

If these strategies are implemented, the business could:

* **Reduce churn by up to 20%** in the first year
* **Increase revenue** through higher customer retention
* **Build stronger customer relationships** and trust
* **Save on marketing costs** by not needing to replace lost customers
